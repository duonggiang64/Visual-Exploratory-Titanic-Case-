# 📊 Visual Exploratory Data Analysis

### 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** through visual techniques using Python. The notebook `Visual Exploratory.ipynb` demonstrates how to uncover data patterns, relationships, and trends using statistical graphics and visualization libraries.

---

### 🧠 Objectives

* Perform **data cleaning** and **summary statistics**.
* Visualize distributions, correlations, and categorical relationships.
* Identify key patterns and insights in the dataset through effective data visualization.
* Support data-driven decision-making by revealing hidden trends.

---

### ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

**Language:** Python
**Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

**Key Libraries Used:**

* `pandas` – Data manipulation
* `numpy` – Numerical operations
* `matplotlib` – Basic plotting
* `seaborn` – Advanced statistical visualization
* `plotly` (optional) – Interactive charts

---

### 🧩 Workflow

1. Load and inspect the dataset.
2. Handle missing values and outliers.
3. Create univariate, bivariate, and multivariate plots.
4. Analyze feature relationships and correlations.
5. Summarize visual insights and potential implications.

---

### 📊 Key Insights

* Visualization helps quickly identify trends and anomalies.
* Correlation plots and pairplots reveal strong variable relationships.
* Categorical and numerical features exhibit distinct behavioral patterns worth deeper analysis.
